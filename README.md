j-3d-view-pgb-helloworld-basic
==============================

An easier version of googles 3D viewer jsc3d.js  in phongap build.




Notice I have used a direct link to the js files to make things easier. On the more advanced version I will try to embed the js files into the app so they work offline


        <script type="text/javascript" src="http://jsc3d.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jsc3d/jsc3d.js"></script>
